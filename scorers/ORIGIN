This folder contains the evaluation scripts provided by the SemEval 2017 Task 4 organizers. I 
made a copy of the subtask A scoring script and renamed it 'scoreA.pl' for ease of use. I did not otherwise modify any of the files. 

These scripts were obtained from http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools
under Section II. Scorers and format checkers for all subtasks.
