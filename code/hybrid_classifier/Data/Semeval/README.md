Semeval Data
=======================

Due to copyright reasons, the SemEval team didn't allow to distribute these datasets. However, for research purpose, I may e-mail you these datasets under request.

The files under this folder should have the following structure.

.
├── DevSet
│   └── twitter-dev-gold-B.tsv
├── TestSet
│   └── 2014
│       └── SemEval2014-task9-test-B-input.txt
└── TrainSet
    ├── twitter-train-gold-B-2013.tsv
    └── twitter-train-gold-B-2014.tsv

Alternatively you may change the file run_semeval_classifier.py to determine the new file paths.
